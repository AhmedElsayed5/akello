# Contributing to Akello

Akello is an open-source project, and we love both code and non-code contributions! People with any level of experience
can make an important impact on the project: you don't need to be a professional developer! You might have just:

- **Ten minutes** to write a GitHub issue describing a bug you found or request for a feature you could use
- **One hour** to learn and participate in one of our webinars
- **Four hours** to author a case study showcasing how you've used Akello

This section provides instructions on how to get started contributing to the Akello project.
If you're looking to _use_ Akello, check out the [App](./app) or [API](./api) docs instead.

## Join our online community

We have several online venues where Akello community members and team members convene, offering various ways
to get involved with the project:

1. Star the [Akello Github repository](https://github.com/akello-io/akello)
2. Join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/WSqNrWBKKw) - and introduce yourself
3. Subscribe to [Akello on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/akello-io/)

### Spread the word and participate

Help us reach and engage people passionate about building amazing healthcare solutions!

1. Let us know your thoughts on [Github Discussions](https://github.com/akello-io/akello/discussions)
2. Share our [blog posts](/blog)
3. Share code, posts, videos or other content in relevant online forums for example [dev.to](https://dev.to/),
   [/r/healthIT](https://www.reddit.com/r/healthIT/), [/r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/),

## Making a contribution

There are several ways to make your first contribution to the Akello project! The following instructions
should help you get started.

### Reporting a bug or discussing a feature idea

If you found a technical bug on Akello or have ideas for features we should implement, the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/akello-io/akello/issues)
is the best place to share your ideas.
[Open a new issue](https://github.com/akello-io/akello/issues/new) describing the changes you'd like to see, and one of
our team members will respond.

### Writing documentation or blog content

Did you learn how to do something using Akello but it wasn't obvious on first try? Please contribute to our documentation!

Our documentation is hosted on [akello.io/docs](/docs), but it is built from [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
files that live in our [Github repository](https://github.com/akello-io/akello/tree/main/packages/docs).

For relatively small changes, you can edit files directly from your web browser on [github.dev](https://github.com/akello-io/akello/tree/main/packages/docs)
without needing to clone the repository.

### Fixing a bug or implementing a new feature

If you find a bug on Akello and open a GitHub Pull Request that fixes it, we'll review it as soon as possible.

Before starting implementation of a new feature, open an issue first to discuss your plans and to ensure it fits into
our roadmap and plans for the app. If for some reason we don't accept your PR, you're welcome to [fork our repository](https://github.com/akello-io/akello/fork)
and implement it in your own version.

**Ready to get started writing code?** First things first, you need to [clone the Akello repository](./contributing/local-dev-setup).
