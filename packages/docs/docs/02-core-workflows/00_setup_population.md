# Setup your population

Akello manages your population with our patient registry. A population is a group of patients with common conditions, enabling you to implement a uniform treatment model for all.


## Create a new registry
Setting up a new registry is easy with Akello. You can create as many registries as you like and add any number of patients to each. Plus, you can control access to ensure patient data stays secure.

1. On the homepage, find and click the "Create New Registry" button located at the top right.
2. Go through the setup process.
3. Choose the screeners you need for this group.

## User Access

With Akello, you can make sure that only those treating patients in the population can access the registry. To add a user, simply enter their email. If they're not already on Akello, they'll get an invite to join. After signing up, they'll be able to see the registry they were invited to.
