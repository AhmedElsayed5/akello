##  The Open-Source Philosophy of Akello
In the realm of healthcare, the prevalence of proprietary solutions often results in obscured methods of processing and storing clinical data. This lack of transparency can impede the seamless integration and evolution of advanced, patient-centric experiences. Furthermore, it risks negatively impacting patient care and exacerbates the fragmentation of healthcare services.

Akello represents a fundamental departure from conventional market offerings. We proudly stand as the inaugural open-source integrated population health platform.

Our commitment to open-source is anchored by five core principles:

### 1. Quality
   Our development process is entirely public, inviting scrutiny and contributions from thousands of engineers globally. This contrasts sharply with the limited feedback loop of perhaps a dozen engineers in closed-source environments, enhancing our code's robustness and reliability.

### 2. Agility
   Akello is designed using modular, reusable framework components. This approach not only facilitates extensive customization and diverse solution development but also significantly accelerates the creation of unique and tailored patient experiences.

### 3. Transparency
   At the heart of Akello is a commitment to clarity. Users have complete visibility into how patient data is processed and stored, ensuring trust and accountability.

### 4. Security
   Our platform undergoes rigorous daily audits by external developers and periodic reviews by professional auditors. This constant vigilance ensures the highest levels of security and data protection.

### 5. Innovation
   By obviating the need to reconstruct basic healthcare components, we aim to catalyze innovation within the industry. Our goal is to foster advancements that extend well beyond Akello's capabilities, setting new benchmarks in healthcare technology.

## What Sets Akello Apart?

Akello stands out by offering unparalleled flexibility, freeing you from the constraints of being bound to a single vendor. This allows you the freedom to blend various elements to craft perfectly tailored care experiences. Additionally, for those who prefer not to dedicate time to engineering, Akello offers a comprehensive management solution.
