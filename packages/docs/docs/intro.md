# üôè Welcome

Hi we are excited that you are here. Akello is designed as a measurement based platform and we aim to do the following:

1. Help clinical teams run integrated population health models that are based off of measures
2. Work collaboratively as team around
3. Engage both patients and clinicians in treatment programs
4. Make billing simpler for the model the team is using

If you have any questions or would like to directly chat with us right away you can connect with us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WSqNrWBKKw).

# Why is Akello open-source?

Regrettably, in healthcare, many solutions are proprietary, which conceals the methods of processing and storing clinical data. This hinders the integration and development of superior, engaging experiences for patients. Moreover, it may adversely affect patient treatment and further compartmentalize their care.

Akello is a radical alternative to solutions in the market. We are the first open-source integrated population health platform.

There are 5 pillars that drive our decision towards open-source:
### 1. Quality

### 2. Agility
### 3. Transparency
### 3. Security
### 4. Innovation

# Patient Registry

A core part of our product is rooted from a patient registry. The registry services as a collection of patients with similar conditions and treatments making it simpler for a clinical team to manage a larger population. A few components are critical for a successful registry:

1. Run repeatable models
2. Run treat-to-target strategy
3. Collect measures
4. Flag patients

# Integrated Care

Akello aims to break the silos of clinical treatments by making it easier for clinical teams to work collaboratively.
