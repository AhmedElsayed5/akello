## Collaborative Care Model (CoCM)

The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is a healthcare approach that integrates primary care with mental health services. It involves a team comprising a primary care provider, a behavioral health manager, and a consulting psychiatrist, working together to treat mental health conditions within a primary care setting. This model employs systematic patient tracking, measurement-based care, and a treatment-to-target strategy, aiming to improve mental health accessibility, enhance service quality, and achieve better health outcomes.
