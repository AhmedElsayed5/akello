# Akello is Open Source!

We've got some exciting news to share. We've decided to make Akello open source! This is a big step for us in the healthcare tech world, and we're super excited about it. Why, you ask? Well, it's all about making things better and more transparent. By going open source, we're opening up our platform to the community. This means more eyes on our code, leading to better security and more innovative features. Plus, it's a great way to connect with other tech enthusiasts and professionals who are as passionate about improving healthcare as we are. We can't wait to see where this journey takes us and how it will help us serve you better. Stay tuned for more updates!
